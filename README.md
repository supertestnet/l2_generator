# L2 Generator
Make your own L2

# How to try it
Just click here: https://supertestnet.github.io/l2_generator

# What is it?
Run this software to compete with Phoenix, Voltage, and other LSPs. L2 Generator is a lightning-compatible layer two for bitcoin -- no node required! Put some bitcoin in it, connect it to a lightning backend, and you're off and running. Anyone can deposit money to your L2 and get their own self-custody bitcoin wallet with send/receive buttons and their own balance. You can charge money for the use of your channels, and your users can withdraw at any time, even if you disappear, because they hold their own keys. L2 Generator is also designed to (eventually) let you manage your users, track your income and expenses, and bill your customers -- if you find any freeloaders, you can kick them off!

# How does it work?
It's built on [my hedgehog software](https://github.com/supertestnet/hedgehog) with a few goodies thrown in from [Nostr Wallet Connect](https://nwc.dev). NWC lets the software create and pay LN invoices, and hedgehog lets your users unilaterally exit -- they're only *renting* your Nostr connection, for a fee, and you can manage their usage and bill them for your service. Just like Voltage or Phoenix!
